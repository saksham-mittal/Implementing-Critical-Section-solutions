# Implementing-Critical-Section-solutions
The goal of this assignment is to implement a multithreaded solution for critical section problem using: test_and_set, test_and_set with bounded waiting and compare_and_swap.

The performance analysis along with the design of the programs is done in the Report for all three techniques.

This assignment was a part of OS-II course.
